I am a programmer and a CPA accountant. My primary focus is on large-scale, efficient web scraping using Python, Scrapy, Selenium and VBA.

As a freelancer, I have spent time solving data aggregation problems across major sites (i.e. Zillow, Yelp, Yahoo, Zomato, YellowPages to name a few). This blog provides tutorials and walkthroughs on how to scrape these websites and hopefully, to teach people (programmers or not) how to grab data more efficiently.
